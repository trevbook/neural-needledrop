    "# **Finalizing Pipeline**\n",
    "In **`02. Prototyping Data Pipeline`**, I scoped out the entire data pipeline. Once I knew that it was running properly, I wanted to make it more configurable and contained. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is going to be similar to that notebook, but will invoke entire configurable pipeline methods instead of multiple-cell stretches for each section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the methods invoked will correspond with a step of the pipeline. There are a couple of different ones: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialize Cloud Resources:** This will make sure that all of the GBQ tables & GCS buckets exist. It'll have an optional attribute for deleting *everything*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Download Video Metadata:** Next up: downloading some video metadata. This will identify which videos that a user needs to find, and then uses `pytube` to download some metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enrich Video Metadata:** This step will determine what type of video each video is (album review, weekly track roundup, etc.), and extract review scores from the description\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downloading Video Audio:** This step will download the audio of videos we haven't downloaded yet\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transcribing Audio:** Next: this step uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe all of the audio we've downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding Transcriptions:** Finally, we're going to embed some of the transcriptions that we've created using Whisper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods shares a couple of key design steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Idempotency: The methods can be retried, and won't necessarily overwrite things\n",
    "- Logging: Each of the methods logs information (using various logging levels) to Google Cloud Logging \n",
    "- Configurable: Different parameters of the pipeline step can be indicated through command line arguments. I've also got a way to load in these configurations via .yml files. "
